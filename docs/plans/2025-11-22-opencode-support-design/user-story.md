# User Story

As a Superpowers user on OpenCode,
I want native OpenCode skill discovery and invocation,
so that I can use the same skill workflows across Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode.

## Business Goal

- Make OpenCode a first-class platform for Superpowers workflows.
- Reuse core skill discovery logic across platforms.
- Keep skill activation behavior consistent for users.
