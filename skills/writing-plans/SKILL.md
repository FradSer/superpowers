# Writing Plans

## Core Concept

Use this skill to create executable implementation plans that reduce ambiguity for whoever executes them.

Explicit over implicit, granular tasks, verification-driven, context independence.
**MANDATORY**: Tasks must be driven by BDD scenarios (Given/When/Then).
**MANDATORY**: Test-First (Red-Green) workflow. Verification tasks must precede implementation tasks.
When plans include unit tests, require external dependency isolation with test doubles (DB/network/third-party APIs).

## Workflow

**Phase 1 - Plan Structure**: Define goal, architecture, constraints. 
- **MANDATORY**: Read `bdd-specs.md` from the design folder (generated by `brainstorming`).
- Use `./references/plan-structure-template.md`.

**Phase 2 - Task Decomposition**: Break into small tasks mapped to specific BDD scenarios.
- **CRITICAL**: Every task must explicitly reference a BDD Scenario (e.g., "Implement Login (ref: Scenario 1)").
- **CRITICAL**: Verification steps must run the BDD specs (e.g., `npm test tests/login.spec.ts`).
- Enforce Red-Green ordering: Task N (Test/Red) -> Task N+1 (Implementation/Green).
- Ensure tasks are compatible with `superpowers:behavior-driven-development`.

**Phase 3 - Validation & Documentation**: Verify completeness, confirm with user, save to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-plan/` folder (must include `_index.md` and linked task files), commit.

## Exit Criteria

Plan created with clear goal/constraints, decomposed tasks with file lists and verification, BDD steps, commit boundaries, no vague tasks, user approval.
