I have a design document entrypoint at docs/plans/2026-02-06-checkout-design/_index.md with behavior requirements in Given/When/Then style.

Please implement this feature using behavior-driven-development:
- derive scenarios first from the design intent
- run red/green/refactor for each behavior
- stop and escalate if repeated attempts show no progress
